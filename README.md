## Histopathological-based analysis of spatial transcriptomics data on human kidney sample: toward precision pathology

This repo includes the R, Julia, and Python scripts we wrote for the main and supplemental figures. 

For each figure, it usually contains two parts: 
- 1) Seurat analysis in R / Scanpy analysis in Python
- 2) CellScopes visualization in Julia
